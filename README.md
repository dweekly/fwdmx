Forwarding.MX - A DNS-driven Forwarding Mail Server
-------------------------------------------

Forwarding.MX is a forwarding MX server that references DNS TXT
records to determine the destination for an inbound
message. Messages can be forwarded to one or multiple
email addresses or sent to a 'webhook'.

Forwarding.MX uses [Haraka](http://haraka.github.com/),
a high-performance SMTP server built on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/),
so you must have Haraka installed before attempting to configure Forwarding.MX.

See [Forwarding.MX](http://Forwarding.MX/) for more details.
